# SUSU_Httpd
A simple C++11 http CGI server

This project references the design of the tinyhttpd

https://github.com/larryhe/tinyhttpd

I hope to create a httpd for myself,so I begin to build SUSU_Httpd,just for fun.

# how to use this httpd

1.use these code to build a demo

	make demo
	
2.run the remo

	cd ./demo
	
	./run.sh
	
3.check your address and port.

	
4.if your address is 192.168.0.103,and susu_httpd is listening port 12345

	you can use 192.168.0.103:12345 in your WebBroser,so you can see the demo web.
